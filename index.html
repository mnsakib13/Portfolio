                    Brainiac is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character
                    was created by Otto Binder and Al Plastino and first appeared in Action Comics #242 in July 1958.
                    Brainiac is usually depicted as an extraterrestrial android or cyborg who serves as one of
                    Superman's greatest enemies and a major adversary of the Justice League. He is known for shrinking
                    and stealing Kandor, the capital city of Superman's home planet Krypton, and is even responsible for
                    Krypton's destruction in some continuities.
                    
                    <br/><br/>

                    The character's name is a portmanteau of the words brain and maniac. In 2009, Brainiac was ranked
                    by IGN as 17th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time. He has been substantially adapted into
                    various forms of media, having been voiced by Corey Burton in various television shows set within
                    the DC animated universe, by John Noble in animated film Superman: Unbound, and by Jeffrey Combs in
                    the video game Injustice 2. In live-action television, Brainiac has been portrayed by James Marsters
                    on Smallville and by Blake Ritson on Krypton.
